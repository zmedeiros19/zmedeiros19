Hello, this project's goal is not to be a financial advisor but rather to make the user more aware of their spending habits using visuals and easy-to-keep track lists.
Please Start by using "npm install chart.js" so you will be able to view the pie chart that is displayed. Then Run the HTML file and use the browser of your choice (I recommend Google Chrome).
Once this is done the program will run, enter your budget, and then add your expenses and a name for them.
If you go over budget a red "OVER BUDGET'' warning will appear in place of the chart. However, you will still be able to see the list of expenses when you press down along with how much you are over budget.
If not over budget you will be able to see a pie chart breakdown of your spending
When you press done a list of your expenses will appear as well
As previously stated this project is meant to help people visualize their expenses
As a college student, I find many others struggle with this and it leads to them putting themselves in even more debt than just the loans they took out for the degree.
I believe financial health is very important and impacts many things not limited to well-being and mental health which is a significant problem. 
Through using this tool I hope people can better see what and where they are spending their money on so they can make better choices to help them and their future.
